#Android Boot Manager (ABM), my goal is to make the procedure (Backup, Unpack, Edit, Repack and Flashe boot.img or recovery.img) so easy and accessible to all users without resorting to the command prompt , only a single click to get a quick and successful outcome at the same time .
This is the second version of the program.


TODO
- add support to x86, mips arch.
- add support to put files to unpacked folder.
- add support to combinedboot , in Xperia device recovery ramdisk is combined with system ramdisk.

IMPORTANT
- The apk need root access to work.
- Note that make change by adding files to unpacked folder with root explorer, the owner will be root and the apk will not work, if you do this you must change the owner to ABM apk.
